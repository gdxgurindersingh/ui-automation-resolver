### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you dive in, make sure you have the following set up on your machine:
```text
Java 8 or higher
Maven
```

### üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your project up and running:
1.	Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gdxgurindersingh/ui-automation-resolver.git
```
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd ui-automation-resolver-assessment
```
3.	Run the tests:
```shell
mvn clean test
```

### üìà Generate Allure Report
Allure Reports provide a clear, visual representation of your test results. Here‚Äôs how to generate and view the Allure Report:

To generate the Allure report, run the following Maven command:
1.	Generate the report:
```shell
mvn allure:report
```
2.	Serve the report to view in your browser:
```shell
mvn allure:serve
```


### üîÑ Toggle Headless and Browser Options

For flexibility, you can toggle between headless and non-headless modes and switch browsers using Maven commands:
1.	Run tests in headless mode using Chrome:
```shell
mvn clean test -Dheadless=true -Dbrowser=chrome
```
2.	Run tests in non-headless mode using Chrome:
```shell
mvn clean test -Dheadless=false -Dbrowser=chrome
```
3.  Run tests in headless mode using Firefox:
```shell
mvn clean test -Dheadless=true -Dbrowser=firefox
```
4.  Run tests in non-headless mode using Firefox:
```shell
mvn clean test -Dheadless=false -Dbrowser=firefox
```


## ü§ñ Key Features and Design Decisions

### Page Object Model (POM)

We use the POM design pattern to keep our code clean, maintainable, and reusable. Each page of the application has a corresponding Page Object class that models its behavior and elements.

### Utilities and Helpers

Our utility classes (found in the /utils directory) encapsulate common functionalities such as browser setup, logging, and configuration management. This promotes code reuse and simplifies test writing.

### Logging

We use Log4j2 for logging. Our log4j2.xml configuration file is set up to provide detailed logs, helping you understand the test flow and debug issues effectively.

### Configuration

The config.properties file holds all configurable parameters like browser type, headless mode, and URLs. This makes our tests flexible and easy to configure for different environments.



## üß© Fun Bits
1. Screenshot on Failure: For every failed test, a screenshot is captured and saved in the target/screenshots directory. These screenshots are also attached to the Allure Report for easy debugging. 
2. Email Reports: After a test suite runs, an email report is sent out, ensuring that stakeholders are promptly informed of the test results.


## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up Your Environment
### For Mac:
```text
1.Install Homebrew (if not already installed):
        /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
2.Install Java: 
        brew install --cask adoptopenjdk8
3. Install Maven:
        brew install maven
```
### For Windows:
```text
1.	Install Java: Download and install the latest JDK from the official website.
2.	Install Maven: Download and install Maven from the official website.
3.	Set Up Environment Variables:
‚Ä¢	JAVA_HOME: Point this to your JDK installation directory.
‚Ä¢	MAVEN_HOME: Point this to your Maven installation directory.
‚Ä¢	Update PATH: Add both JAVA_HOME and MAVEN_HOME to your system PATH.
